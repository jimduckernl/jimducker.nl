During my studies I've acquired a diverse set of skills, both from school and on my own. Below you will find more thorough explanations of how much I know and why I think it's a good skill to have. Shortly summed up this is what I currently know:

- [Linux](#linux)
- [HTML / CSS](#html--css)
- [JavaScript](#javascript)
- [HUGO](#hugo)
- [PHP](#php)
- [SQL](#sql)
- [C# / .NET](#c--net)
- [Xamarin](#xamarin)
- [DevOps](#devops)
- [Git](#git)
- [VMware](#vmware)

# Linux
Linux has been one of my hobbies for about a year now. During my internship at Heras I really discovered my love for this open-source OS. I used Linux on a raspberry pi to host the web framework we were using on. During that same period, I also built my pc, on which I decided to install Linux to experiment a bit more at home. 

I really liked how there are many different versions (or distros) to try out and how you can change anything, because it's open source. 

Not only have I just used Linux for personal use though. I configured my own Debian server to host this very website right here. By having used it at home, I feel comfortable using the terminal and know all the commands to navigate around.

# HTML / CSS
In my first year as a *Software Developer* student they started teaching us HTML / CSS. I learned the basics in school but expanded my knowledge more at home. Currently I'm using [HUGO](#hugo) for this website, which allows for easier and more efficient website building. But I still have lots of experience building websites using just HTML and CSS (with some JavaScript).

# JavaScript
Together with HTML / CSS I also learned some JavaScript. I haven't used JavaScript to it's fullest extend yet, but I've used it for functions on some web apps built in school. Outside of school I also learned some jQuery to use for my own projects. 

# HUGO
HUGO is a web framework I learned recently to find a more efficient way to build websites. I prefer it over other alternatives.

# PHP
After having learned HTML, we also learned PHP to make websites with a functional back end. 
During my internship at Heras we also used PHP for the web-app we created. 

# SQL
In school we also learned SQL, MSSQL specifically but I've also used MySQL during my internship (they're not that different though of course). They've also taught us the right way to think about the table structures for different types of applications.

# C# / .NET
During the second and third year, we learned to create CRUD applications using C# / .NET. I've got quite a bit of experience creating CRUD applications that also work with databases, because these are one of the most common types of applications.

I've gotten quite familiar using Visual Studio and different C# libraries to extend the functions of the applications that I build. During the Hackathon we worked together to create a full-stack app where I created an API in C#.

# Xamarin
After having learned C#, we transitioned from windows forms application to creating apps using Xamarin. They taught us a bit in school, but I also used it myself before that, to create an app for a hackathon.

# DevOps
During the entire second and third year I've been using DevOps for all my school projects. In school we get taught how to use DevOps to work together on projects and track our progress.

# Git
I also have experience using Git. I use Git for a lot of progress to make sure my code is always saved somewhere. We also use Git together with DevOps in group projects, to work together on the same program.

# VMware
In school we also got taught some more general computer skills like using virtual machines using VMware. I've installed and configured tens of virtual machines myself, either for just experimenting at home or for a school assignment. I like trying out different operating systems and virtual machines are a really easy way to do them. I've also configured some servers on virtual machines.
