          <h1 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m a 19 year old software developer student currently living in The Netherlands, but looking to go to Sweden for my next internship. I&rsquo;ve always had a passion for all kinds of stuff regarding technology, but I especially love to build.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been studying software development for around 3 years at the Koning Willem I College in &rsquo;s-Hertogenbosch, and interned at Heras. Though I learn a lot at school, my interest takes me even further. This is especially true for hardware and linux, in which I found great passion during my internship. I love occupying myself with projects at home like server hosting and writing programs that help me out.</p>
<p>When looking at a lot of stuff I always think it can be done simpler and more efficient. Which goes for skills I learn myself too. I love looking for ways to improve and be more efficient like learning the keybindings of an IDE or vim, or writing my own scripts to automate repetitive tasks. Sometimes this takes time but the end result is always worth it, since it is something that will save time forever.</p>
<h1 id="my-current-aspirations">My current aspirations</h1>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m in my final year of the software developer course I&rsquo;m following. After my exams are finished there follows a six month period where I&rsquo;ll be interning at another company. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m currently looking for an internship in Sweden to also learn more about cultures abroad. If you happen to have open opportunities for software developer students at your company, feel free te e-mail me at <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="mailto:jim@soverin.net">jim@soverin.net</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<h1 id="my-goals">My goals</h1>
<p>Learning is a big passion of mine. Though I&rsquo;d love to always get my hands on the newest hardware, I think that there&rsquo;s lots of value in learning what&rsquo;s already out there.</p>
<p>My curiosity isn&rsquo;t just contained to technology though, I love experiencing and reading about different cultures around the world. I&rsquo;d love to continue seeing different places and learn more skills in the future.</p>
