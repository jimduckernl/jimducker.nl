<h2 id="software-developer---koning-willem-i-college">Software Developer - Koning Willem I College</h2>
<p>This is the course that I&rsquo;m currently following. I&rsquo;m in my third and final year, preparing for my final exams. The course focusses on making you an all-round software developer, teaching you a diverse set of <a href="https://jimducker.nl/skills/">skills</a> like: HTML / CSS, Javascript, PHP, .NET / C# and SQL. Besides the coding languages we learn to work with widely used software and systems like VMware and DevOps. During the course we also go on <a href="#internships">internships</a> to learn more about how it is to be in the actual workplace.</p>
<p><a href="https://kw1c.nl"><img src="kw1c.jpg" alt="Koning Willem I College"></a></p>
<h2 id="student-council---koning-willem-i-college">Student Council - Koning Willem I College</h2>
<p>During my studies I also decided to sign up for the student council. The student council has weekly discussions about new policies, organising activities and improving the students&rsquo; life within the school, along with many other subjects. We don&rsquo;t just sit there and discuss, however, we organise seasonal activities and make sure the new policies actually get added in the school.</p>
<p>After a merge with another school, a lot of the student council got revamped and I became the head of the <em>inlcusivity and sustainability</em> commission. The commission has the task to make sure all students feel welcome and comfortable within the school and make sure the school continues its path to becoming a green and sustainable school. We do this by helping organise activities representing minority groups of people and implementing new green ideas on campus.</p>
<p>In a way, I learned just as much from the student council as I did from my studies in school. Not in terms of building software, but by introducing me to how everything runs within a big organisation and how to get stuff done by taking the right actions.</p>
<h2 id="vmbo-t---kempenhorst-college">VMBO-T - Kempenhorst College</h2>
<p>This was my middle / high school education. It wasn&rsquo;t anything special, I learned the basic set of skills any student learns. This was the time, however, where I discovered my interest in building software. I also opted in for the optional <a href="#anglia-examinations">Anglia Examinations</a> to become better at the English Language.</p>
<h1 id="internships">Internships</h1>
<h2 id="heras">Heras</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.heras.co.uk/"><img src="heras.png" alt="Heras B.V."></a>
During the first half of my second year I interned at Heras. Heras is an <em>international</em> protection company. That means that they come up with and make solutions across many different sectors. They&rsquo;re widely known for their security solutions which include fences, gates, cameras and other solutions.</p>
<p>I interned as a software developer along with two other interns for six months. During our internship we were tasked with building a full-stack application that would be used by prisons in the Netherlands and the UK.</p>
<p>This internship taught me a lot about how it is to actually work as a software developer. Building the full-stack application also taught me a lot as we&rsquo;ve never truly done that in school before. I was mostly in charge of doing the back-end, like getting the application to be hosted on <em>linux</em> and setting up the database using <em>MySQL</em>.</p>
<h1 id="certificates">Certificates</h1>
<p>During my studies I&rsquo;ve also earned a few certificates. They&rsquo;re nothing special, but nice little add-ons to have.</p>
<h2 id="anglia-examinations">Anglia Examinations</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.anglia.org/">Anglia Examinations</a> was a program that my middle / high school offered. It was available for the students who wanted to learn English at a higher level than the normal school program would teach you.</p>
<p>After finishing the exams you get a certificate stating that you&rsquo;re proficient in B2-level English.</p>

<p><a href="https://hackathonmasters.com/">Hackathon Masters</a> is an organisation that hosts hackathons throughout the Netherlands. During my second year at Koning Willem I College I participated in one of the hackathons organised at our school. Together with three other students, we developed an app using Xamarin for <em>&lsquo;Stichting Praktijkleren&rsquo;</em>, a charity that supplies educational material for kids that need it.</p>
<p>This was the first ever hackathon I ever participated in. It taught me a lot about working in a high stress level environment, as we only had four days to develop the app. We didn&rsquo;t get <em>first</em> place, sadly, but we did get the second, for being my first hackathon I still consider that pretty good.</p>
