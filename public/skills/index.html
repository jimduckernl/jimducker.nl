<h1 id="linux">Linux</h1>
<p>Linux has been one of my hobbies for about a year now. During my internship at Heras I really discovered my love for this open-source OS. I used Linux on a raspberry pi to host the web framework we were using on. During that same period, I also built my pc, on which I decided to install Linux to experiment a bit more at home.</p>
<p>I really liked how there are many different versions (or distros) to try out and how you can change anything, because it&rsquo;s open source.</p>
<p>Not only have I just used Linux for personal use though. I configured my own Debian server to host this very website right here. By having used it at home, I feel comfortable using the terminal and know all the commands to navigate around.</p>
<h1 id="html--css">HTML / CSS</h1>
<p>In my first year as a <em>Software Developer</em> student they started teaching us HTML / CSS. I learned the basics in school but expanded my knowledge more at home. Currently I&rsquo;m using <a href="#hugo">HUGO</a> for this website, which allows for easier and more efficient website building. But I still have lots of experience building websites using just HTML and CSS (with some JavaScript).</p>
<h1 id="javascript">JavaScript</h1>
<p>Together with HTML / CSS I also learned some JavaScript. I haven&rsquo;t used JavaScript to it&rsquo;s fullest extend yet, but I&rsquo;ve used it for functions on some web apps built in school. Outside of school I also learned some jQuery to use for my own projects.</p>
<h1 id="hugo">HUGO</h1>
<p>HUGO is a web framework I learned recently to find a more efficient way to build websites. I prefer it over other alternatives.</p>
<h1 id="php">PHP</h1>
<p>After having learned HTML, we also learned PHP to make websites with a functional back end.
During my internship at Heras we also used PHP for the web-app we created.</p>
<h1 id="sql">SQL</h1>
<p>In school we also learned SQL, MSSQL specifically but I&rsquo;ve also used MySQL during my internship (they&rsquo;re not that different though of course). They&rsquo;ve also taught us the right way to think about the table structures for different types of applications.</p>
<h1 id="c--net">C# / .NET</h1>
<p>During the second and third year, we learned to create CRUD applications using C# / .NET. I&rsquo;ve got quite a bit of experience creating CRUD applications that also work with databases, because these are one of the most common types of applications.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten quite familiar using Visual Studio and different C# libraries to extend the functions of the applications that I build. During the Hackathon we worked together to create a full-stack app where I created an API in C#.</p>
<h1 id="xamarin">Xamarin</h1>
<p>After having learned C#, we transitioned from windows forms application to creating apps using Xamarin. They taught us a bit in school, but I also used it myself before that, to create an app for a hackathon.</p>
<h1 id="devops">DevOps</h1>
<p>During the entire second and third year I&rsquo;ve been using DevOps for all my school projects. In school we get taught how to use DevOps to work together on projects and track our progress.</p>
<h1 id="git">Git</h1>
<p>I also have experience using Git. I use Git for a lot of progress to make sure my code is always saved somewhere. We also use Git together with DevOps in group projects, to work together on the same program.</p>
<h1 id="vmware">VMware</h1>
<p>In school we also got taught some more general computer skills like using virtual machines using VMware. I&rsquo;ve installed and configured tens of virtual machines myself, either for just experimenting at home or for a school assignment. I like trying out different operating systems and virtual machines are a really easy way to do them. I&rsquo;ve also configured some servers on virtual machines.</p>
