      <description>Who am I? I&amp;rsquo;m a 19 year old software developer student currently living in The Netherlands, but looking to go to Sweden for my next internship. I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a passion for all kinds of stuff regarding technology, but I especially love to build software.
What I do I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying software development for around 3 years at the Koning Willem I College in &amp;rsquo;s-Hertogenbosch, and interned at Heras. Though I learn a lot at school, my interest takes me even further.</description>
